\section{Architecture}
The architecture of EcoCode is a reflection of its primary objectives: to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for  code optimization and CO2 emission estimation. The application leverages a client-server model, integrating various technologies and frameworks to achieve its goals. This section details the architectural choices and the rationale behind them. The system architecture diagram, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:system_architecture}, provides an overview of the main components and their interactions within EcoCode.

\subsection{Overall Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture_presentation}

The architecture of EcoCode is described in greater detail, including comprehensive explanations of each component and more detailed architectural diagrams.

\paragraph{Backend Components:}
The backend, built using Flask, handles concurrency, error handling, and database integration efficiently. The detailed architecture is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:system_architecture}.

\paragraph{Component Interaction:}
Detailed interaction diagrams illustrate how components communicate and process user requests. This includes data flow diagrams and sequence diagrams. See Figures \ref{fig:data_flow_diagram} and \ref{fig:sequence_diagram}.

\paragraph{Workflow Diagram:}
The workflow diagram below illustrates the overall process from code submission to displaying results (Figure \ref{fig:workflow}).

\paragraph{Sequence Diagram:}
The sequence diagram illustrates the step-by-step interaction flow from the user's perspective (Figure \ref{fig:sequence_diagram}).

\subsection{Integration with OpenAI and CodeCarbon}
A key feature of EcoCode is its integration with external APIs for code optimization and CO2 emission estimation.

\subsection{Integration with OpenAI and CodeCarbon}
A key feature of EcoCode is its integration with external APIs for code optimization and CO2 emission estimation.

\textbf{OpenAI API}: The application utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model for analyzing and suggesting optimizations for the submitted code. GPT-4's advanced natural language processing capabilities enable it to understand and process code efficiently, providing valuable insights and optimization suggestions.

\textbf{CodeCarbon}: For estimating the CO2 emissions associated with running the original and optimized code, EcoCode integrates with the CodeCarbon API. CodeCarbon offers a way to estimate the energy consumption and carbon footprint of computing tasks, which is crucial for assessing the environmental impact of software.

\subsection{Data Flow}
The data flow within EcoCode is streamlined for efficiency and clarity. When a user submits code via the frontend, the request is sent to the Flask server. The server then forwards the code to the OpenAI API for analysis. The response from OpenAI, containing optimization suggestions, is processed by the server and combined with CO2 emission estimates obtained from CodeCarbon. The consolidated results are then sent back to the frontend for display to the user.

Figure \ref{fig:workflow} illustrates the workflow of the EcoCode application from code submission to the display of results. The sequence diagram in Figure \ref{fig:sequence_diagram} outlines the step-by-step interaction flow from the user's perspective.

\subsection{Security and Scalability}
Considering the nature of the application, security and scalability are key concerns. Secure HTTP (HTTPS) is recommended for deployment to ensure data privacy and integrity. Flask's scalability supports handling a growing number of users, and its compatibility with various database solutions allows for future enhancements, such as storing user sessions or optimization histories.

\subsection{Mathematical Notation}
To quantify the efficiency of code optimizations, the following mathematical model is proposed:

\textit{Efficiency Gain (E)} = \textit{Time Original (T\textsubscript{o})} / \textit{Time Optimized (T\textsubscript{opt})}

Where \textit{Time Original (T\textsubscript{o})} is the execution time of the original code, and \textit{Time Optimized (T\textsubscript{opt})} is the execution time after optimization. A higher value of \textit{E} indicates a more significant efficiency gain.

\subsubsection{Example Test Case}
Consider a Python function for calculating the sum of the first N natural numbers. The original code uses a for loop, while the optimized code uses the arithmetic series formula.

\textbf{Original Code:}
\begin{verbatim}
def sum_natural_numbers(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total += i
    return total
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Optimized Code:}
\begin{verbatim}
def optimized_sum(n):
    return n * (n + 1) / 2
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Execution Time Measurement:}
Using a stopwatch, the execution time for N = 10,000 was measured:

- Time Original (T\textsubscript{o}): 0.002 seconds
- Time Optimized (T\textsubscript{opt}): 0.0001 seconds

\textbf{Efficiency Gain Calculation:}
\textit{E} = $\frac{T_{o}}{T_{opt}} = \frac{0.002}{0.0001} = 20$

This implies that the optimized code is 20 times more efficient in terms of execution time.

\subsection{Compile Time and Energy Usage Measurement}
To measure the compile time and energy usage, the following approach is used in the code:

\begin{verbatim}
import time
from codecarbon import EmissionsTracker

def measure_compile_time_and_energy(code):
    start_time = time.time()
    # Assuming compile_code is a function that compiles the code
    compile_code(code)
    compile_time = time.time() - start_time

    tracker = EmissionsTracker()
    tracker.start()
    compile_code(code)
    emissions = tracker.stop()

    return compile_time, emissions
\end{verbatim}

This code snippet captures the compile time and energy usage for a given piece of code, using a timer and the CodeCarbon tracker.

\subsection{Overall}
The architecture of EcoCode is designed to be simple yet effective, aligning with the principles of Green IT. The integration of Flask, OpenAI, and CodeCarbon, along with a user-friendly frontend, makes EcoCode a tool that not only aids in software optimization but also promotes awareness of environmental sustainability in software development.

\section{Proof-of-Concept Production}
The EcoCode project has been developed as a prototype to demonstrate the practical application of integrating code optimization with environmental impact awareness. The proof-of-concept focuses on two main components: the backend, developed in  using Flask and OpenAI APIs, and the frontend, which is a simple yet functional web interface designed with HTML. Below are descriptions and excerpts from both components to illustrate the current status of the project.

\subsection{Backend Implementation}
The backend of EcoCode serves as the core for processing user requests. It is written in  and utilizes Flask, a lightweight web framework, for handling HTTP requests and responses. The integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 API allows for the analysis and optimization of the submitted  code. Additionally, the CodeCarbon API is used to estimate the CO2 emissions associated with the execution of the original and optimized code.

\textbf{Key Code Excerpts}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=]
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from openai import OpenAI
from codecarbon import EmissionsTracker

client = OpenAI(api_key='your_api_key')

app = Flask(__name__)

# Functions for code analysis and optimization
def analyze_code(code):
    # ... function implementation ...

def optimize_code(code):
    # ... function implementation ...

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    # ... route implementation ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Frontend Design}
The frontend of EcoCode offers a user-friendly interface for submitting  code and viewing the analysis results. It is built using HTML and provides a clear and straightforward way for users to interact with the application. The design ensures that users can easily submit their code, and view both the optimized version and the estimated CO2 emissions.

	\item As declared in the assessment procedure of the University of Luxembourg, plagiarism is committed whenever the source of information used in an assignment, research report, paper or otherwise published/circulated piece of work is not properly acknowledged. In other words, plagiarism is the passing off as one’s own the words, ideas or work of another person, without attribution to the author. The omission of such proper acknowledgement amounts to claiming authorship for the work of another person. Plagiarism is committed regardless of the language of the original work used. Plagiarism can be deliberate or accidental.
	      Instances of plagiarism include, but are not limited to:
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Not putting quotation marks around a quote from another person’s work
		      \item Pretending to paraphrase while in fact quoting
		      \item Citing incorrectly or incompletely
		      \item Failing to cite the source of a quoted or paraphrased work
		      \item Copying/reproducing sections of another person’s work without acknowledging the source
		      \item Paraphrasing another person’s work without acknowledging the source
		      \item Having another person write/author a work for oneself and submitting/publishing it (with permission, with or without compensation) in one’s own name (‘ghost-writing’)
		      \item Using another person’s unpublished work without attribution and permission (‘stealing’)
		      \item Presenting a piece of work as one’s own that contains a high proportion of quoted/copied or paraphrased text (images, graphs, etc.), even if adequately referenced
	      \end{enumerate}
	      Auto- or self-plagiarism, that is the reproduction of (portions of a) text previously written by the author without citing that text, i.e. passing previously authored text as new, may be regarded as fraud if deemed sufficiently severe.
