\section{Architecture}
The architecture of EcoCode is a reflection of its primary objectives: to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for  code optimization and CO2 emission estimation. The application leverages a client-server model, integrating various technologies and frameworks to achieve its goals. This section details the architectural choices and the rationale behind them.

\subsection{Overall Architecture}
EcoCode is structured around a web-based interface, allowing users to interact with the system via a standard web browser. The application is built using the Flask framework, a lightweight and flexible  web framework. Flask was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency, which aligns with the project's Green IT principles.

\textbf{Frontend}: The frontend is developed using HTML5 and CSS, providing a clean and intuitive user interface (UI). The UI includes a text area for code input and sections for displaying the analysis results, optimized code, and CO2 emission estimates. JavaScript is minimally used to enhance interactivity without compromising performance.

\textbf{Backend}: The Flask server, forming the backbone of the application, handles requests from the frontend, processes them, and returns the results. Flask's ability to handle HTTP requests and responses efficiently makes it an ideal choice for this application.

\subsection{Integration with OpenAI and CodeCarbon}
A key feature of EcoCode is its integration with external APIs for code optimization and CO2 emission estimation.

\textbf{OpenAI API}: The application utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model for analyzing and suggesting optimizations for the submitted  code. GPT-4's advanced natural language processing capabilities enable it to understand and process code efficiently, providing valuable insights and optimization suggestions.

\textbf{CodeCarbon}: For estimating the CO2 emissions associated with running the original and optimized code, EcoCode integrates with the CodeCarbon API. CodeCarbon offers a way to estimate the energy consumption and carbon footprint of computing tasks, which is crucial for assessing the environmental impact of software.

\subsection{Data Flow}
The data flow within EcoCode is streamlined for efficiency and clarity. When a user submits  code via the frontend, the request is sent to the Flask server. The server then forwards the code to the OpenAI API for analysis. The response from OpenAI, containing optimization suggestions, is processed by the server and combined with CO2 emission estimates obtained from CodeCarbon. The consolidated results are then sent back to the frontend for display to the user.

\subsection{Security and Scalability}
Considering the nature of the application, security and scalability are key concerns. Secure HTTP (HTTPS) is recommended for deployment to ensure data privacy and integrity. Flask's scalability supports handling a growing number of users, and its compatibility with various database solutions allows for future enhancements, such as storing user sessions or optimization histories.

\subsection{Mathematical Notation}
To quantify the efficiency of code optimizations, the following mathematical model is proposed:

\textit{Efficiency Gain (E)} = \textit{Time Original (T\textsubscript{o})} / \textit{Time Optimized (T\textsubscript{opt})}

Where \textit{Time Original (T\textsubscript{o})} is the execution time of the original code, and \textit{Time Optimized (T\textsubscript{opt})} is the execution time after optimization. A higher value of \textit{E} indicates a more significant efficiency gain.

\subsection{Overall}
The architecture of EcoCode is designed to be simple yet effective, aligning with the principles of Green IT. The integration of Flask, OpenAI, and CodeCarbon, along with a user-friendly frontend, makes EcoCode a tool that not only aids in software optimization but also promotes awareness of environmental sustainability in software development.

\section{Proof-of-Concept Production}
The EcoCode project has been developed as a prototype to demonstrate the practical application of integrating code optimization with environmental impact awareness. The proof-of-concept focuses on two main components: the backend, developed in  using Flask and OpenAI APIs, and the frontend, which is a simple yet functional web interface designed with HTML. Below are descriptions and excerpts from both components to illustrate the current status of the project.

\subsection{Backend Implementation}
The backend of EcoCode serves as the core for processing user requests. It is written in  and utilizes Flask, a lightweight web framework, for handling HTTP requests and responses. The integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 API allows for the analysis and optimization of the submitted  code. Additionally, the CodeCarbon API is used to estimate the CO2 emissions associated with the execution of the original and optimized code.

\textbf{Key Code Excerpts}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=]
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from openai import OpenAI
from codecarbon import EmissionsTracker

client = OpenAI(api_key='your_api_key')

app = Flask(__name__)

# Functions for code analysis and optimization
def analyze_code(code):
    # ... function implementation ...

def optimize_code(code):
    # ... function implementation ...

@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def index():
    # ... route implementation ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Frontend Design}
The frontend of EcoCode offers a user-friendly interface for submitting  code and viewing the analysis results. It is built using HTML and provides a clear and straightforward way for users to interact with the application. The design ensures that users can easily submit their code, and view both the optimized version and the estimated CO2 emissions.

\textbf{HTML Template Excerpt}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=HTML]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>EcoCode Web App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Form for code input -->
    <form method="POST">
        <textarea name="code_input" rows="10" 
        cols="50"></textarea>
        <input type="submit" value="Optimized Code">
    </form>

    <!-- Display area for original 
    and optimized code -->
    <!-- ... HTML content ... -->
</body>
</html>
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Current Status and Future Work}
As of now, the EcoCode is in a prototype stage. The application successfully allows users to submit  code, receive an optimized version, and view the estimated CO2 emissions. Future work will focus on enhancing the UI/UX design, incorporating additional features such as user authentication, and extending support for other programming languages. The scalability and security aspects will also be addressed in subsequent development phases.
